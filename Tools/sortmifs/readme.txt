SortMIFS 1.0 by Robert Mahle robert.mahle@extendedtools.com

Badmifs occur when data_loader fails to load a hardware delta mif into the database.  
This is not a problem if the client later receives a SMS resync request and sends 
an entire hardware inventory back up to the server.  Data-loader should then insert 
the full inventory into the database.  SortMifs was written to parse your badmifs 
and ensure the clients have later resynchronized with the server. 

Unzip sortmifs.zip and run sortmifs.exe /? for help and syntax. 
It is recommended to run sortmifs from the server locally when dealing with large 
amounts of badmif files. Also note that running it on the server will detect all of 
the necessary command switches for you.


Excel columns explanation:
Client Name - The name of the client who generated the MIF

GUID - Client's unique sms ID

IP Address - Client's IP Adress

Domain - Client's domain

Mif files - each badmif file generated by this client is listed in this field

Count of Mifs - total count of files from the mif files column

Newest MIF file date - This list the date and time stamp of the newest badmif file

SMS Last Inventory date - Last date and time a mif was successfully loaded into the 
			  SMS database. This field contains two times:
			  1. The actual time in the database
			  2. The time used to compare to the badmif file date.  

			  The second time is used when comparing because of a time 
			  lag in the bad mif file showing up on a central site and 
			  the last inventory time is set when the client ran 
			  hardware inventory locally.

Status – The result of comparing the last inventory date to the sms database’s last 
         inventory date to find out if the client successfully synchronized inventory.

you can use the follwoing command to run it:


F:\Media\12374sortmifs>sortmifs dbserver=PRODSCM dbname=SMS_KBS xls=F:\eswar.xls
 mifdir=E:\SCCM\inboxes\auth\dataldr.box\BADMIFS /S /DEL
